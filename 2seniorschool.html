        <h2>At JPC, the senior years are all about helping you prepare for life beyond school. You’ll be working toward your NCEA qualifications, and you’ll have the chance to tailor your learning through a wide range of subject choices that suit your interests, goals, and strengths. Whether you’re aiming for university, apprenticeships, creative industries, or another pathway, our teachers are here to guide you with experience and care. You'll also be supported by our careers and academic mentoring teams to ensure you're on track.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>Senior students play an important leadership role at JPC, setting the tone for the rest of the school. You’ll have opportunities to lead in many ways – through sports, arts, cultural events, academic mentoring, liturgies, and service. Our school places strong emphasis on developing confident, compassionate young people who are ready to contribute to their communities with both skill and heart.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>Starting at a new school can feel daunting, but here at JPC, you won’t be doing it alone. Our friendly student leaders, deans, and support staff are here to help you transition smoothly and make the most of your time with us. We’re proud of our inclusive, faith-centred environment and look forward to seeing you grow into the person you are called to be. Welcome to JPC – we’re so glad you’re here.</h2>

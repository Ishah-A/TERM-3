        <h1>Our School Values</h1>
        <h2>At John Paul College, our core values guide everything we do and shape the way students learn, grow, and interact with others. Rooted in Catholic faith and tradition, the values of Faith, Hope, and Love are central to school life. These are not just words but principles that influence daily actions—encouraging students to develop a strong sense of purpose, kindness, and compassion in everything they do..</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>Students are encouraged to live out these values both in and outside of the classroom. Faith inspires trust in God and confidence in oneself. Hope motivates students to aim high and stay positive, even in challenging times. Love is expressed through respect, service, and care for others. These values create a warm and supportive environment where students feel safe, valued, and inspired to make a difference in their communities.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>We learn to follow Jesus’ teachings by showing care and respect for others, standing up for what’s right, and helping those in need. Faith teaches us to trust in God and ourselves. Hope helps us stay strong and positive when things are hard. Love means looking after others, being kind, and forgiving. Whether it’s in the classroom, on the sports field, or with our friends, we try our best to live out these values every day.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">

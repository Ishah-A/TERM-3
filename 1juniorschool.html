        <h2>At JPC, we offer a supportive learning environment where students are encouraged to grow both personally and academically. You’ll be part of a school that values respect, service, and faith. Our school motto, "Ma te pono, me te aroha," is reflected in the way we treat each other and strive to make a positive difference in our community. As you settle in, you’ll have the opportunity to build lasting friendships, take part in a wide range of sports, cultural groups, music, and service opportunities, and grow your confidence through new challenges.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>Each year level brings exciting new learning experiences. Each year you’ll have a form teacher who will essentially be your go to teacher for any concerns, and a broad introduction to different subjects. As you progress into Year 9 and 10, you’ll begin to explore more subject choices and develop your interests as you prepare for NCEA in the senior years. Our teachers and student leaders are here to guide you, and there’s always someone to support you if you have questions or need help adjusting.</h2>
        <br> <hr class="hr1">
        <h2>We are glad you’re here, and we hope your time at JPC is full of learning, fun, and memorable moments. Welcome aboard - your journey starts now!</h2>
